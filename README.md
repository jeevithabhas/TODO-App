# Frontend

This is the frontend for the TODO application, which provides a user interface for managing tasks. It's built using React and Tailwind CSS.

## Overview

The frontend allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. It connects to the backend API to fetch and manipulate the tasks data. The application is styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design.

**Key Features:**
- **Responsive Design:** Uses Tailwind CSS to ensure the application looks good on all devices.
- **Task Management:** Users can add, view, update, and delete tasks through an intuitive interface.
- **Completion Status:** Visual indicators show which tasks are completed.
- **Progress Indicators:** Display progress bars for task completion.
- **Dynamic Feedback:** Provides real-time updates and feedback as users interact with the application.

**How It Works:**
1. **User Interface:** The main interface consists of a task list, input forms for adding tasks, and buttons for updating and deleting tasks.
2. **API Interaction:** The frontend communicates with the backend using RESTful API calls to perform CRUD operations on tasks.
3. **State Management:** React's state management handles the dynamic updates and ensures the UI reflects the current state of tasks.
4. **Styling:** Tailwind CSS provides a modern and responsive design, making the application visually appealing and easy to use.
